•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
	 We utilize fast-forward to get to the target branch from the current branch tip, by advancing the pointer from the current branch tip to the target branch.

•  Why should you have different branches? 
	 Because, many developers work on same project simultaneously. Therefore, by having different branches developers can do their work without disturbing the original code.

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	 We may build as many Git repositories as the project requires, to allow many teams to work on the same code.
